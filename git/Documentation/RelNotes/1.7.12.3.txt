Git 1.7.12.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.12.2
---------------------

 * "git fetch" over http had an old workaround for an unlikely server
   misconfiguration; it turns out that this hurts debuggability of the
   configuration in general, and has been reverted.

 * "git fetch" over http advertised that it supports "deflate", which
   is much less common, and did not advertise the more common "gzip" on
   its Accept-Encoding header.

 * "git status" honored the ignore=dirty settings in .gitmodules but
   "git commit" didn't.

Also contains a handful of documentation updates.
